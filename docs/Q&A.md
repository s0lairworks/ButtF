## Q: Can I use BUTTF on any website?
## A: Only on systems you own or have permission to test… unless you want the FBI as a new pentester 😬

## Q: Why the name?
## A: See Funfact.md. TL;DR: it’s funny, memorable, and looks scary in CLI.

## Q: How do I pick which tests to run?
## A: Modules are like toppings on pizza — pick what you want, don’t get greedy, and enjoy the chaos 🍕

## Q: Does it find real bugs?
## A: Yep, if the backend is vulnerable… otherwise, it just insults your target politely.

## Q: Will it ruin my own systems?
## A: Maybe. Backup first. Cry second. Deploy third.

## A: Thanks for wanting to help improve BUTTF! 🖤
